Load image data from a text file (image_data.txt) using AJAX.
Display the images one by one with a fade-in/fade-out effect.
Allow the user to navigate through the images using previous and next buttons.
Update the image data from the text file on demand.
Show an info overlay when an image is clicked, displaying the filename and duration.
Hide the info overlay when the close button is clicked.
I'll break down the code into sections:

Variables and Initialization:
imageData: An array to store image data.
currentImageIndex: The current index of the displayed image in the array.
imageTimeout: A variable to store the timeout reference for the next image.
loadImageData(): This function uses AJAX to fetch image data from a text file and then calls the displayImage() function to display the first image.

displayImage(index): This function takes an index and displays the image with a fade-in/fade-out effect. It also sets a timeout for the next image based on the duration specified in the image data.

Event handlers: The code sets up event handlers for the following actions:

Clicking on the previous and next buttons.
Clicking on the update button to reload the image data.
Clicking on an image to display its info overlay.
Clicking on the close button to hide the info overlay.
Initialization: The script calls loadImageData() to initialize the gallery.
Now, let's discuss some improvements:

Use more descriptive variable names: Some variable names (like xhr, img, and imageInfo) can be made more descriptive for better readability.

Replace jQuery with vanilla JavaScript: Modern JavaScript has come a long way and supports most of the functionality provided by jQuery. It's a good idea to replace jQuery with vanilla JavaScript to reduce dependencies and improve performance.

Error handling: Add proper error handling for cases like a failed AJAX request, an issue with JSON parsing, or when the text file is not found.

Accessibility: Improve accessibility by adding proper ARIA attributes to buttons and other interactive elements. Use semantic HTML tags like <button> for buttons and <figure> and <figcaption> for images and captions.

CSS transitions: Consider using CSS transitions instead of jQuery's fadeIn() and fadeOut() for smoother and more performant animations.

Code modularity: You could separate the code into smaller, reusable functions, making it easier to maintain and expand upon in the future.
